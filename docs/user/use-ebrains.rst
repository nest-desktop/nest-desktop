**Trouble shootings**

Why cannot I find NEST Simulator?
  Sometimes the issue is resolved when you check NEST Simulator.

  If not, the problem lies in the cookies and site data for the user authentication of the *EBRAINS* platform.
  That cookie expires after a session.
  This happens when you re-access to ``https://nest-desktop.apps.hbp.eu`` after the browser is closed.

  A simple solution is to reload the page with deleting the cookies
  (:guilabel:`CTRL` + :guilabel:`SHIFT` + :guilabel:`R`) so that you can re-login.

  A persistent solution is to set the browser configuration so that it deletes cookies
  and site data when the browser is closed (It works in Firefox) -
  but avoid to accidentally delete cookies you want to keep!

.. warning::
   Please avoid to accidentally delete cookies you want to keep!
   Ensure to export your projects if you want to keep them -
   the save button stores them only in the cookie!
