This part of the documentation shows how to deploy NEST Desktop on OpenShift resources.
In the following, we will use the deployment process of NEST Desktop on the OpenShift resources of EBRAINS as an example of practice.

Requirements:
  * `OC Client Tools <https://www.okd.io/download.html#oc-platforms>`__


.. _deploy-nest-desktop-on-ebrains:

**Deploy NEST Desktop on EBRAINS**

EBRAINS provides two OKD infrastructures:

  * https://okd-dev.hbp.eu for the development and
  * https://okd.hbp.eu for the production.

.. note::
   I strongly recommend to use the development page for testing.

.. _register-client-for-authentication-on-ebrains:

**Register client for authentication on EBRAINS**

To access to NEST Desktop on EBRAINS infrastructure, an authentication is requested.
You find the codes on https://github.com/nest-desktop/apache2-oidc.

Here are the steps how to setup the authentication for NEST Desktop properly.

.. code-block:: bash

   bash get-dev-token.sh

Change the configuration file and then create a client for your application.

.. code-block:: bash

   bash create-client.sh

Keep ``client_id`` and ``client_secret`` for the **okd** infrastructure.

|

.. _build-nest-desktop-on-ebrains:

**Build NEST Desktop on EBRAINS**

First, copy the command line from the web console of ``https://okd-dev.hbp.eu`` and enter in terminal to login via ``oc``:

.. code-block:: bash

  oc login https://okd-dev.hbp.eu:443 --token=<TOKEN>

Get the status of the current project:

.. code-block:: bash

  oc status

You can find the configurations on https://github.com/nest-desktop/nest-desktop-ebrains.
Therein, you have to modify the environment for EBRAINS authentication,
i.e. ``OIDC_CLIENT_ID`` and ``OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`` of NEST Desktop
(which is printed after setting up the client for NEST Desktop).

Execute the bash script to deploy the ``nest-desktop``, ``nest-server`` and ``apache2-oidc`` containers:

.. code-block:: bash

  bash setup-nest-desktop.sh

|

.. _further-usage:

**Further usage**

Scaling up the replicas (pods or nodes):

.. code-block:: bash

  oc scale --replicas=2 dc nest-desktop
