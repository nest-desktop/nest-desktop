Hello there! :-)

NEST Desktop is a web-based GUI application for NEST Simulator,
an advanced simulation tool for the computational neuroscience.

The app enables the rapid construction, parametrization,
and instrumentation of neuronal network models.

**Version info**

On Read the Docs, it is possible to select versions of this documentation.
This can be done in the left side bar at the very bottom.
These versions basically relate to the program versions (as found in the GitHub repository).
This can be noticed when clicking on a the "Edit on Github" text at the top in the middle.

Since the changes between patch level versions (e.g. 2.4.0 and 2.4.1) are usually not noticeable, we show a single branch for the recent minor version releases (e.g. '2.4' for all 2.4.x releases).
This branch contains all patch releases and always points to the latest patch release of that release branch.
Please keep this in mind when searching for information on a specific version of NEST Desktop!
