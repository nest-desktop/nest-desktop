# Security Policy

## General Information

NEST Desktop is research oriented software and as such is expected to
run mainly in well-protected environments. In case it is found that this
software can be used to violate security mechanisms, developers will try to
provide patches that mitigate the risk of this misuse. However, this
cannot be guaranteed and usually, this might be realized only for the most
recent version available. Please check the repository for available
updates.

The current policy is explained in SECURITY.md in the nest-desktop main branch.
The policy can also be found at <https://github.com/nest-desktop/nest-desktop/security/policy>.

## Supported Versions

Generally, only the latest version will receive security related updates.
Currently, the following versions are being supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 3.2.x   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| < 3.2   | :x:                |
